# Agent Workspace Rules

- Avoid AI tropes and excessive AI fingerprints such as em-dashes ("—"),
  headline biscuit pills, overly robotic filler, and unnatural prose in message
  templates and generated outputs. Prefer clean, standard hyphens ("-") and
  natural human-like formatting.
- Imports in every file must be organized descending by line length (longest on
  top to shortest on bottom of the imports section).
- After fixing any problems or completing code modifications, you MUST always
  run the following commands sequentially to verify and format the codebase (run
  cmds without specifying a file):
  1. `deno check`
  2. `deno lint`
  3. `deno fmt`
- Always follow Clean Code and SOLID principles.
- Avoid overly large files and complex syntax.
- In all files: include a top-of-file comment describing what the file does and
  why it is needed (giving the most important context up front). Always write
  good comments on functions and non-obvious code, adhering to good commenting
  practices.
- This workspace is DENO-only. Always choose DENO native libraries/ways instead
  of DENO-first libraries or NODE libraries (this should only be used as a last
  resort).
- All test scripts, debug scripts, and other helper files created by agents must
  be saved inside the `scripts/` directory. Never leave scratch files in the
  repository root.
